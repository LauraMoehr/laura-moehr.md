# About Me

My name is **Laura**, i'm a 34 years old **Junior Web Developer** based just outside Stuttgart. As of February 2022 I have just completed an intense _web development bootcamp_ with Neue Fische Hamburg. My Capstone Project is an online version of the party board game "The Champion Of The Wild" - a kind of "Animal Olympics" for 3 to 8 players.

I've built the App using JavaScript and React, Node.js, Express, MongoDB and mongoose, long polling and publish/ subscribe, styled-components, Git/Github...

In my free time I love to go _hiking_, _watching the birds_, _reading_ a good book...
