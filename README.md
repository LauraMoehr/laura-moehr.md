# About Me

My name is **Laura**, i'm 34 years old Junior Web Developer based just outside Stuttgart. AS of February 2022 I have just completed an intense _web development_ bootcamp with Neue Fische Hamburg. My Capstone Porject is an online version of "The Champion Of The Wild" - a party board game for 3 to 8 players.

In my free time I love to go _hiking_, _watching the birds_, _reading_ a good book...
